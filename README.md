## üìñ Project Overview

This project is a collaborative database course design focused on creating an **Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) Information System**. It enables users to query, explore, and visualize various aspects of ICH data, including the cultural, geographic, and descriptive elements of different heritage entries. We have also integrated **map-based visualization** to help users locate heritage sites geographically.

## üöÄ Features

- **Comprehensive Query System**: Easily search and filter ICH entries by categories, regions, historical significance, etc.
- **Map Visualization**: Interactive map with **location-based visualization** for a better user experience, powered by Leaflet and React.
- **Detailed Heritage Information**: Each heritage entry includes descriptions, images, and other relevant metadata.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes.

## üîß Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- **Bun**
- **Java** (JDK 21)
- **PostgreSQL** database setup

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/stepbystepcode/Intangible-cultural-heritage.git
   cd Intangible-cultural-heritage
   ```

2. **Install Frontend dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   bun i
   ```

3. **Install Backend dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd ../backend
   ./gradlew build
   ```

### Database Setup

1. **Create a PostgreSQL database** for the ICH system.
2. **Run migration scripts** if available or use the ERD to set up tables manually.

### Running the Application

1. **Start the Backend**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ./gradlew bootRun
   ```

2. **Start the Frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   bun dev
   ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5713` (or as specified).

## üìç Map Visualization

Our system utilizes [**React-Leaflet**](https://react-leaflet.js.org) to provide a seamless map-based user experience. Users can view and interact with the locations of cultural heritage items directly on the map.

## üí° Future Improvements

- **User Authentication**: Enable personalized experiences and save user preferences.
- **Advanced Filtering**: Enhance search functionality with additional filters.
- **Interactive Map Layers**: Add more detailed map layers for richer geographic context.
